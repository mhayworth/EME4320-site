    <h3>Collaborative AI Ethics Handbook</h3>
    <p>For this module, you will be finding examples of AI that was not ethically designed, trained, or deployed. You will discuss what the issue was in 
        the development of this AI system, who was impacted or marginalized by its outcomes, and what should have been changed from a design, training, or 
        deployment perspective to prevent such issues. You will add your entry to a Google Docs page below with a few keywords so that you can refer to 
        this document in the future when you have to consider AI systems. The first entry is already filled out with the story of a Chatbot deployed 
        by Microsoft called Tay. Cases to report on can be found online, one such resource is from <a href="https://aiethics.princeton.edu/case-studies/case-study-pdfs/" target="_blank">Princeton.</a>
         You can also review the following PDF on AI Ethics from the <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2023-08/USAID%20AI%20ETHICS%20GUIDE.pdf" download>U.S. Agency for International Development.</a>

    <h3>Module Assessment</h3>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><b>AI Ethics Presentation: </b>Use generative AI to help develop a presentation that outlines your entry to the AI Ethics Handbook. Focus 
        ethical guidelines for design, training, and deployment of AI systems. Use your example as a way to justify a point you would include in an AI Ethics Framework. 
        Examples of points include "Ensuring quality data", "Consdiering the needs of marginalized populations", or "Fortifying against adversaries".</p><br>
