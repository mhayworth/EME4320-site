            Many people feel uncertain about the future of AI. But in reality, it has many
            important applications that can improve all of our lives. In this course,
            we will be exploring a subfield of AI called multimodal machine learning (ML).
            We will use multiple methods, ranging from simple libraries to complex machine 
            learning frameworks such as TensorFlow. Additionally, we will explore how to properly
            prepare and label data for supervised machine learning. The course will have multimedia content 
            including images, videos, and audio tutorials about multimodal ML. After this course,
            you should be able to apply these fundamentals to your own datasets and build a system
            that can make predictions - your own AI! Finally, we will overview current AI
            research and applications, from image recognition in medical applications to helpful
            assistants like ChatGPT.
